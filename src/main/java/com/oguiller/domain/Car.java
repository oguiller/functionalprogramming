    /**
     * So, you're probably starting to get the idea that constructors, public constructors, are not very flexible.
     * You'll have to have constructors, but they can be private or they can have less than public access.
     * But a factory method is generally good. Factories can limit the consequences of certain types of change.
     * In particular, whether you're creating a new object every time or whether you're perhaps reusing some existing old ones.
     * We also have the opportunity with the factory to allow the return of something that isn't the exact type that was specified,
     * but is merely something that is assignment compatible. Another thing that's going on here, which is worth pointing
     * out cause this is another very important functional design pattern, is that these factories are actually
     * returning objects whose primary purpose is behavior. So now we've actually seen two scenarios where
     * behavior is being passed around. We started out passing behavioral objects into functions and
     * now we're getting behavioral objects as the return value from a function
     *
